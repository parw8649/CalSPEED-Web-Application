# Calspeed

CalSPEED Network Speed Measurement Tool is a web application which empowers end-users with a professional-level, industry-standard testing tool to measure the quality and speed of their residential fixed internet connection. Users can test their upload speed, download speed, message delay (Latency), and message delay variation (Jitter) using this web application. It allows users to know if the quality of service they are receiving is worth the price. Originally the CalSPEED application required a download and an installation. Our team has created and optimized a web-based application from scratch that only requires a web browser to access, and also is mobile friendly. The tool now is maintenance free and provides users with portability and security.
